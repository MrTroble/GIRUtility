## Description

TC Utility is a Minecraft mod that adds over 450 building and decorating blocks to your game. Currently, everything can only be used in creative mode. The mod was originally developed for a server project to add various building blocks like slabs, stairs and doors. As well as replace blocks with tileentity with normal blocks.
The mod uses a Json-based registration system, so new blocks can be added easily without changing anything in the program code.
